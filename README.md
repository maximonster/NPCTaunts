Are some special circumstances built into the plugin where every NPC has the oppurtunity to comment(Yes even your pets)
## Custom taunts
Custom taunts can be set up in the config of the plugin for extra taunts.
You can add one boss/npc per line using their exact in-game name followed by a **";"** then add all your custom taunts and separate those with **":"**

Example:

Vorkath;That didn't salve anything:Say hi to Torfinn

TzKal-Zuk;{Playername} cannot tank a {Lasthit}:Zuk this


Extra options you can add in your taunts:
* If you want to use the last fought enemy in the sentence place: {Enemyname}
* You can add the playername to the sentence using: {Playername}
* You can add the last hit taken using: {Lasthit}
* You can add the colosseum title using: {Title} (Currently only works in colosseum)
* You can add the wave the person died on using: {Wave}
* You can add the colosseum modifier the person last selected using: {Mod}
